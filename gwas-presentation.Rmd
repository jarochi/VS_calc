## Increasing role of biofilm in human health

Recent studies are reporting more and more way of biofilm (and biofilm-producing bacteria) affecting human health.

Chapman, lupus, Crohn disease, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer

## Development of biofilms

Although general regulators of the biofilm biogenesis are known, there are still no large-scale studies associating phenotype (biofilm production) with genotype.

## Available strains

The collection of **Salmonella** ($n = 50$) and **Escherichia** ($n = 200$) strains is currently being sequenced proving an unique insight into genomic variability of **Enterobacteriaceae** (CHECK NAMES).
